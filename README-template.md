## My process

### Built with

- TypeScript
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I gained experience with a state management library (specifically Zustand). I discovered that utilizing Zustand was more convenient compared to prop drilling. Additionally, I experimented with Framer Motion to incorporate simple animations, which proved to be effective in animating elements that are conditionally rendered.

### Continued development

In my upcoming projects, I aim to enhance the architecture to ensure better organization and structure. Furthermore, I aspire to enhance the consistency of my SCSS code, as I haven't had extensive experience with it thus far.
